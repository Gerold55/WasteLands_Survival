# the Swapper
The Swapper is a sorting machine.
It takes items from the lower four slots and takes a look whether they are the same as the ones at the long sides.
If an item matches, it is moved to the output on the side where an item of the same type could be found.
If the item didn't match any then it is moved to the upper slots.
The items in the output slots can be taken using takers on the sides with the according color.
The other side is for inserting items using a mover.
