A new version of LemonLake's factory mod for minetest.
It adds machines for your factory.
For transportation there are vacuums, conveyor belts, fans and many more.
For production there are industrial furnaces, auto crafters and also many more.
There are also a few sorting devices.
And to stop the coal distribution madness there are electronic devices too.
